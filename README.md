# React Part Time Class Final Project

## Project Links

- [CodeSandbox Link]()

## Project Description

I will be creating a recipes Application where I can search recipes, get details about them such as ingredients, nutrients and similar recipes.


## Wireframes

### Recipes Page
![Wireframe--Recipes](https://github.com/patbou02/rctr-final-project/blob/main/Wireframe--Recipes.png)
### Individual Recipe

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP EXAMPLE
- Home page displaying main list of recipes
- Recipes listings will pull in data from the [Spoontacular API](https://spoontacular.com)
- Clicking on single recipe card will open up more detailed view of recipe containing much more information
- Similar recipes will be displayed on a sidebar of the recipes detail page
- Use external library for front end "look and feel" will also provide basic responsiveness functionality

#### PostMVP EXAMPLE

- Ability to filter recipes based on several factors
- Ability for user to favorite a recipe
- Ability for user to add recipes car
- Polish the responsiveness of the app for multiple types of displays (i.e. mobile, tablet, desktop, etc...)

## Spoontacular API

Spoontacular API will be used to gather food/recipe data that will be served to users. Documentation is available at [Spoontacular's Documentation page](https://spoontacular.com/food-api/docs)

```
{data: {} }
```

## Components
##### Writing out your components and its descriptions isn't a required part of the proposal but can be helpful.

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into stateless/stateful components. 

| Component | Description | 
| --- | :---: |  
| App | This will make the initial data pull and include React Router| 
| Header | This will render the header include the nav | 
| Footer | This will render the header include the nav | 


## Additional Libraries
[React Boostrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) will be used as a framework for building the Components in a way that these fit as seamlessly as possible with the React methodology and architecture while providing all of the benefits expected from the Boostrap framework.

## Code Snippet

Use this section to include a brief code snippet of functionality that you are proud of an a brief description.  Code snippet should not be greater than 10 lines of code. 

```
function reverse(string) {
	// here is the code to reverse a string of text
}
```
